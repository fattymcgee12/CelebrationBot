# CelebrationBot
It's time to celebrate! Posts a random holiday for today's date and mentions a random user in the server to share how they're going to celebrate the holiday. Runs every day at 10AM EST, when the bot starts up, and when the !celebrate command is invoked. All holidays are pulled from checkiday.com, and a link to the holiday's description is provided in each run.
